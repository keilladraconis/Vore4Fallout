# Vore4Fallout
 Vore mod for Fallout 4

Inspired by:
[ColdSteelJ's Weight Gain mod](https://www.deviantart.com/coldsteelj/art/Fallout-4-WeightGain-mod-ssbbw-730902010)
[Carreau & Gat's Fallout Vore](https://aryion.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=79&t=58266)

## Reasoning
Fallout Vore 3.0 is very hard to install, buggy, and hasn't been updated in some time. Its features are extensive, complicated, and difficult to comprehend in the code. It also conflicts with Coldsteel's weight gain mod, since both mods fight over the same sliders. This is a reimplementation with the goal of being simple, easy to install, and easy to maintain.

## Goal
Make consumption more interesting, with real gameplay impact and fun features. You now have limits on how much food you can eat, and eating lots of food (as you are force to do early game) will make you fat, and being fat has upsides and downsides. Consumption has RPG elements, benefitting from your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, and offering temporary boosts as well. Your stats will affect how your body shapes up.

Limits spice up gameplay, making stimpaks and other non-fattening health items more precious. Pushing beyond your limits is a fun way to earn boons.

Time is fun. Beds and sleeping have an actual purpose other than advancing the clock; you metabolize 2x faster while sleeping or resting. Otherwise, you cannot simply pound 10 molerat kebabs while ducking and covering, then pound 10 more 2 minutes later. If you eat yourself into immobility, you'll have to suffer the consequences, or find a clever way out of them.

## Not Included
Frankly, I think most of this stuff should be scoped to companion mods. A great deal of the excessive complexity of both of the inspiration mods is their everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach. 

* Quests, Books, Items, Weapons.
* Male vore.
* Atomic Beauty support
* UI widgets
* Configurability
* Companion stuff
